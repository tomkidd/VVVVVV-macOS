#  VVVVVV for macOS with Xcode project

This is a port of the C++ version of the game VVVVVV based on [the source release](https://github.com/TerryCavanagh/VVVVVV) from Terry Cavanaugh in 2020. 

This version is functionally identical to the original source code except it packages the game into an .app bundle with the data file. I did this as a stepping stone to my [iOS/tvOS port](https://github.com/tomkidd/VVVVVV-iOS) of the game. 

Since the original source code uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/) and CMake can generate Xcode projects, anyone wanting to contribute to the main source code of the game should probably reference the [the original code](https://github.com/TerryCavanagh/VVVVVV).
